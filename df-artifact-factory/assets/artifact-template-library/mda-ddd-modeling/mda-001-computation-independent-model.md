# MDA-001 Computation-Independent Model Template

Status: template plus fictional worked example.

Template family: `mda-ddd-modeling`.

Use this template when a DFMS factory run needs `Computation-Independent Model` as a governed SDLC artifact. The template is intentionally standards-based, trace-first, and reviewable by an artifact-specific critic panel.

## Standards and Method Anchors

Primary basis from catalog: OMG MDA.

Family anchors:

- OMG Model Driven Architecture
- CIM/PIM/PSM transformation discipline
- UML/MOF-style model traceability
- DFMS transformation evidence

Global anchors:

- SWEBOK V4 knowledge areas are used as the broad software engineering body-of-knowledge frame.
- ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 is used as the software lifecycle process anchor.
- ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289 is used as the life-cycle information-item/documentation anchor.
- ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 is used for requirements artifacts and requirement quality.
- RUP is used as an iterative, risk-driven lifecycle and artifact/work-product inspiration.
- OMG MDA is used for CIM/PIM/PSM and model transformation artifacts.
- DDD is used for ubiquitous language, bounded contexts, aggregates, and domain invariants.
- NIST SSDF is used for secure development and supply-chain overlays.

## Fillable Template

### 1. Executive Artifact Summary

**Fill:** One dense paragraph explaining what this artifact decides, proves, or enables. Include lifecycle phase, scope boundary, and owner.

**Example:** `Computation-Independent Model` for CareQueue Pro covers referral intake, nurse review queue, patient reminder workflow, and operations dashboard for three clinics and is owned by the clinic operations product owner with DFMS delivery accountability.

### 2. Source Intent and Scope Boundary

**Fill:**

- source answer IDs or transcript references;
- in-scope items;
- out-of-scope items;
- deferred items;
- assumptions;
- constraints;
- approval state.

**Example:** `INT-ANS-014` says nurses need a same-day triage queue; EHR writeback is out of scope for Pilot Release 0.3.

### Model Scope

**Fill:** Define which business concepts, behaviors, constraints, and stakeholders the model covers.

**Example:** In CareQueue Pro, record how `business process` affects referral intake, nurse review queue, patient reminder workflow, and operations dashboard for three clinics.

### Model Elements

**Fill:** List entities, value objects, services, interactions, state, events, constraints, and diagrams.

**Example:** In CareQueue Pro, record how `actors` affects referral intake, nurse review queue, patient reminder workflow, and operations dashboard for three clinics.

### Transformation Links

**Fill:** Trace CIM, PIM, PSM, exceptions, losses, platform decisions, and transformation rationale.

**Example:** In CareQueue Pro, record how `business concepts` affects referral intake, nurse review queue, patient reminder workflow, and operations dashboard for three clinics.

### Model Consistency

**Fill:** Check terminology, invariants, interfaces, quality attributes, and stakeholder validation.

**Example:** In CareQueue Pro, record how `constraints` affects referral intake, nurse review queue, patient reminder workflow, and operations dashboard for three clinics.

### Model Verification

**Fill:** Map model elements to requirements, tests, code, data, and review evidence.

**Example:** In CareQueue Pro, record how `technology-free behavior` affects referral intake, nurse review queue, patient reminder workflow, and operations dashboard for three clinics.


### Traceability Map

### Artifact-Specific Completion Rubric

Score each item 0 to 4 before expert review.

1. Artifact captures business process with owner, evidence, and trace links.
2. Artifact captures actors with owner, evidence, and trace links.
3. Artifact captures business concepts with owner, evidence, and trace links.
4. Artifact captures constraints with owner, evidence, and trace links.
5. Artifact captures technology-free behavior with owner, evidence, and trace links.
6. All source intent links are present and bidirectional.
7. All assumptions have owner, confidence, and revalidation trigger.
8. All decisions include alternatives, rationale, and consequences.
9. All evidence is concrete, inspectable, and not merely a template.
10. All residual risks have owner, expiry, and acceptance state.
11. A future human or agent can resume without hidden context.
12. The artifact has version, date, lifecycle stage, and change history.
13. The artifact-specific critic panel is instantiated and linked.
14. The artifact is concise enough to use but complete enough to audit.
15. The artifact avoids unsupported compliance or quality claims.

### Artifact-Specific Critic Panel

Instantiate these critic seats from `35-artifact-specific-critic-panel-matrix.md`.

1. MDA-001-C1 Business Model Critic: validates business concepts, processes, actors, and domain goals without technology leakage.
2. MDA-001-C2 Domain Expert Critic: validates stakeholder language, business rules, invariants, and workflow truth.
3. MDA-001-C3 Product Outcome Critic: validates value alignment, customer scenarios, and downstream trace to requirements.

Each critic must provide:

- full elite persona contract;
- independent review;
- exactly 15 scored checks;
- adversarial critique of another critic's assumptions;
- failed-point fix evidence;
- pass/revise/fail/split/escalate vote;
- handoff note.

Every governed artifact must also include:

- at least 2 adversarial critics: Anti-Slop Red Team and Failure-Mode/Reality Critic;
- at least 5 RALPH loops: Review, Attack, Learn, Patch, Harden;
- evidence that adversarial critics stood down or escalated unresolved risk;
- proof that token savings were not used to reduce review depth.

### Evidence Bundle

| Evidence item | Path/link | Produced by | Reviewer | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<evidence>` | `<path>` | `<owner>` | `<critic>` | `<pass/rework>` |
| Example review panel | `reviews/mda-001-panel.json` | DFMS quality refinery | artifact-specific critics | example only |

### Handoff Notes

**Human handoff:** `<what the human owner must know, approve, operate, or revisit>`.

**Agent handoff:** `<what the next Codex session must load first, what not to change, and what evidence is authoritative>`.

**Re-entry triggers:** `<conditions that reopen this artifact>`.

### Change History

| Version | Date | Change | Owner | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.1 | `<YYYY-MM-DD>` | Initial draft | `<owner>` | `<link>` |

## Worked Mini-Example

This example is fictional. It exists to show the expected level of specificity, not to define the future project.

- Project: CareQueue Pro (Pilot Release 0.3)
- Scenario: a fictional multi-tenant care-coordination platform for outpatient clinics that manages referral intake, waitlist triage, SMS reminders, escalation tasks, and clinic operations dashboards.
- Customer: Northstar Clinics pilot network.
- Scope slice: referral intake, nurse review queue, patient reminder workflow, and operations dashboard for three clinics.
- Primary risk: handles PHI-like sensitive health data, clinic staffing decisions, external SMS delivery, and future EHR integration.
- Example trace: INT-ANS-014 -> REQ-032 -> ARC-API-006 -> TST-ACPT-019 -> REL-GO-004.
- Artifact-specific focus: business process, actors, business concepts, constraints, technology-free behavior.
- Example decision: accept this artifact only after the MDA Architect, Domain Expert, Product Expert panel resolves failed points and links evidence to the refinery gate.

### Example Artifact Snippet

> For CareQueue Pro, the `Computation-Independent Model` records that the pilot must support referral intake and nurse triage for three clinics while deferring EHR writeback. The artifact links INT-ANS-014 -> REQ-032 -> ARC-API-006 -> TST-ACPT-019 -> REL-GO-004 and remains conditional until the artifact-specific critic panel confirms `business process`, `actors`, and `business concepts` with evidence.

### Example Review Outcome

- Content authority critic: conditional pass pending one fix to `business process`.
- Governance and trace critic: revise until answer IDs are linked to all material claims.
- Verification and handoff critic: revise until rerun evidence and handoff notes are complete.

## Anti-Patterns To Reject

- Generic content that could apply to any project.
- Standards named without concrete artifact sections or evidence.
- Example data left in the real artifact.
- Reviewer hints treated as actual completed reviews.
- Pass certificate without artifact-specific critic panel proof.
- Requirements, decisions, or risks without owner and trace.
- Template text used as evidence.
